# Graham

This is a simple utility around detecting the type of telephone number, and formatting telephone numbers. This first early development version of the utility is designed around UK telephone numbers.

## Where does the name Graham come from?

Good question! As this utility is around phone number type detection, and phone number formatting, it seams fitting to name this after Alexander Graham Bell, the Scottish born inventor credited with inventing and patenting the first practical telephone.
